## Number Lane: Privacy Policy

Welcome to **Number Lane**!

This mobile application is developed by **Shubham Pawar** to bring you an engaging and challenging puzzle experience while ensuring your data remains safe and secure.

### Data Collected by the App

**Number Lane** is designed with your privacy as a priority. Here’s how your game progress is managed:

- **Game Progress:** Your game progress is saved to [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) when an internet connection is available. This cloud storage securely saves your progress so that you can resume your game across different sessions and devices.
- **Local Storage Backup:** When an internet connection is not available, your progress is saved locally on your device, allowing you to continue playing seamlessly.
- **Google Login Integration:** Google Login is used solely for user authentication to save your progress and facilitate identification for multiplayer features. No additional personally identifiable information is collected beyond what is required for these purposes.

### Permissions Requested by the App

The app only requires the following permission to function optimally:

| Permission                         | Reason for Request                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `android.permission.INTERNET`      | Necessary for accessing Firestore through Google Login to store game progress and for enabling multiplayer functionalities. |

### How Your Data Is Handled

- **Cloud Storage with Firestore:** When connected to the internet, your game progress is securely stored on Firestore. This allows you to restore your game progress across devices and sessions, and to participate in multiplayer modes.
- **Local Storage Backup:** If an internet connection is unavailable, your game progress is stored locally. Once connectivity is restored, synchronization may occur to update your progress on Firestore.
- **User Authentication:** Google Login is integrated only for authenticating users to safely save and restore game progress, as well as manage multiplayer sessions. No extra personal information is collected beyond what is necessary for these functions.

### Your Control Over Personal Data

You have complete control over your data:

- **Clearing Data:** Clearing the app’s data or uninstalling the app will remove any locally saved game progress.
- **Revoking Permissions:** You can revoke permissions or disconnect your Google account from your device settings at any time.
