## Color Lane: Privacy Policy

Welcome to **Color Lane**!

This mobile application is developed by **Shubham Pawar** to bring you an engaging and visually stimulating puzzle experience while ensuring your data remains safe and secure.

### Data Collected by the App

**Color Lane** is designed with your privacy as a priority. Here’s how your game progress and potential multiplayer data are managed:

- **Game Progress:** Your level progress is saved using **Play Games Services**, which securely stores your achievements and progress across sessions and devices. This ensures a seamless experience even if you switch devices.
- **Multiplayer Data (Future Implementation):** **Firestore** may be used for managing potential future multiplayer sessions — such as room creation, player status, and game results. No personal data will be stored beyond what is required for these multiplayer features, if implemented.
- **Local Storage Backup:** Your progress is also cached locally on your device for instant access and offline play.

### Permissions Requested by the App

The app only requires the following permission to function optimally:

| Permission                     | Reason for Request                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `android.permission.INTERNET`  | Required to access Play Games Services for syncing progress and potentially Firestore for future multiplayer features. |

### How Your Data Is Handled

- **Play Games Services:** Used for login and securely storing your level progress, achievements, and identity in the game. No additional personally identifiable information is collected beyond what is necessary.
- **Cloud Multiplayer with Firestore (Future Implementation):** Only potential future multiplayer-related data (e.g., player readiness, scores, game state) may be temporarily stored in Firestore. This data would be used to enable real-time multiplayer interactions and may be deleted after the session ends.
- **Local Backup:** Progress is stored locally to ensure uninterrupted play even when offline.

### Your Control Over Personal Data

You have complete control over your data:

- **Clearing Data:** Clearing the app’s data or uninstalling the app will remove any locally saved game progress.
- **Managing Play Games Account:** You can manage or sign out of Play Games Services via the Play Games app or device settings.
- **Multiplayer Session Data (Future Implementation):** Potential future multiplayer session data would be temporary and automatically managed by the system.
